## Duke Software Carpentry Bootcamp in Python (June 16-17)

The Duke CFAR Biostatistics and Computational Biology (BCB) Core is organizing a two-day Software Carpentry bootcamp to help biomedical researchers become more productive by teaching them basic lab skills for computing such as program design, version control, data management, and task automation. This bootcamp will focus on teaching novices the programming language Python for data manipulation, analysis and reporting, and also introduce tools that complement the use of Python in creating reproducible scientific analysis pipelines - the Unix shell, a text editor, Git and a relational database.

* **Date**: 16-17 June 2014
* **Time**: 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM
* **Venue**: Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP) classroom, 2nd Floor, Hock Plaza, 2424 Erwin Road, Durham, NC 27710
* **Cost**: Free (but everyone will contribute towards cost of coffee and snacks)
* **Course website**: [http://cliburn.github.io/2014-06-16-duke/](http://cliburn.github.io/2014-06-16-duke/)
* Instructors: Cliburn Chan, Karen Cranston and Josh Granek

Over the two days, you should gain basic competency with core computing tools that can be used in a research laboratory. To facilitate the application of those skills to your particular laboratory needs, **all bootcamp participants are encouraged to use the BCB Core weekly walk-in clinics held every Wednesday in the SORF conference room from 12:00 - 1:00 to consult on any computing challenges that come up**.

If you are interested in attending the bootcamp, please email <cliburn.chan@duke.edu> with the following information:

The bootcamp will be limited to 35 spaces on a first-come-first-served basis, with preference given to participants affiliated with a CFAR laboratory.
